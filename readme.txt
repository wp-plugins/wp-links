SEO plugin that forces external links to open in a new tab, increasing the time a user spends on your page.

== Description ==

WP Links is a SEO friendly external link handler to improve your on page SEO and increase your visitor time spent on site. 

One of the ways you can increase your search engine ranking is by increasing the time a user spends browsing your website.

This plugin is intended to increase the time a user spends on your page by assisting publishers in HTML markup.

**How does it work?**

The plugin parses links on your post/page/comments/excerpts before it gets written to the screen and adds target="_blank" to the HTML anchor tag. WP Links will preserve title="" and all other anchor tag attributes. 

Additional options are available in the options page.
