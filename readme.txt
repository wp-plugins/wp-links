SEO friendly plugin that forces external links to open in a new tab, increasing the time a user spends on your website potentially increasing your search engine ranking.

== Description ==

WP Links is a SEO friendly, external link handler to improve your on page SEO and increase the time a user spends on your website/blog. One of the ways you can increase your search engine ranking is by increasing the time a user spends browsing your website. 

WP Links also offers the ability to add rel="external nofollow" to all external links. Adding this html attribute to a link effectively stops a link becoming a vote for another page, as far as Google and some other search engines are concerned. As your site grows some links become stale and could hurt your search engine rankings. By using WP Links you can improve your search engine rankings.

= Options =
1. Add rel="external nofollow" to external links
2. Open external links in comments in a new tab
3. Open external links in excerpts in a new tab
 
= How does it work? =

The plugin parses links on your post/page/comments/excerpts before it gets written to the screen and adds target="_blank" to the HTML anchor tag. WP Links will preserve title="" and all other anchor tag attributes. 

Additional options are available in the options page.
